# Create SEI Exam Example

An example script that creates an SEI exam, gets the integration credentials for that exam, and then uses those credentials to delete the exam.

To run, clone the repo, install the requirements, and run "python create_exam.py"

Or, if you have docker, just type "docker run -it caveon/create_exam_example"
